Managing customers is at the heart of ParityDeals. Each customer connects directly to their subscriptions, the plans behind those subscriptions, and the features theyâ€™re entitled to. Understanding these relationships is key to managing the full customer lifecycle. The diagram below gives you a high-level view of how everything ties together:

    CUSTOMER ||--|{ SUBSCRIPTION : "has"
    SUBSCRIPTION }|--|| PLAN : "is_based_on"
    PLAN ||--|{ ENTITLEMENT : "defines_access_via"
    FEATURE ||--o{ ENTITLEMENT : "is_granted_through"
```

This guide provides a complete overview of how to view, add, edit, and understand individual customer details and their associated subscriptions, entitlements, and usage within ParityDeals.
## Viewing the List of Customers

To access and manage your customer data, select the **Customers** section from the main left navigation pane in the ParityDeals dashboard.

This action displays the "Customers" list page. From this screen, you can:
* **Search:** Use the search bar to quickly find a specific customer by name, email, or identifier.
* **Add a new customer:** Click the "+ New customer" button to create a new customer record.
* **Manage individual customers:** Click on any customer's row in the list to navigate to their detailed information page.

## Adding a New Customer

To manually add a new customer record to ParityDeals:

1.  On the "Customers" list page, click the **"+ New customer"** button, located in the top-right corner.
2.  The "Create customer" modal window will appear. You need to fill in the following details:
    * **Customer name *:** (Required) Enter the full name of the individual customer or their company name.
    * **Identifier:** This unique ID is used by ParityDeals to reference the customer internally and via the API. It is auto-generated based on the customer name; however, you can edit it before creation. It's recommended to use this identifier to link to an existing customer ID in your own system if applicable.
    * **Email address (optional):** Enter the customer's primary email address.

3.  **Create multiple customers:** If you need to add several customers consecutively, enable the **"Create more"** toggle switch (this is off by default). When "Create more" is enabled, after you click "Create," the modal will remain open and reset its fields, allowing you to immediately enter the next customer's details.
4.  Once all required details for a customer are entered, click the **"Create"** button located at the bottom-right corner of the modal.
5.  Upon successful creation, a success toast notification will briefly appear. If the "Create more" toggle was not enabled, the modal will close, and the newly added customer will appear in the "Customers" list.
