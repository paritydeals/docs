description: "A step-by-step guide to implementing a usage-based pricing model for your product, including benefits, use cases, and setup instructions."

Usage-based pricing (also known as consumption-based or pay-as-you-go pricing) is a model where customers are charged based on the amount of a product or service they actually use. This contrasts with traditional fixed-fee subscriptions where users pay a set amount regardless of their usage.

This guide will walk you through the benefits, ideal use cases, and the step-by-step process of setting up a usage-based pricing model in ParityDeals.

## Why Choose Usage-Based Pricing? The Benefits

Implementing a usage-based model can offer significant advantages:

* **Fairness and Transparency:** Customers pay only for what they consume, which is often perceived as fairer and more transparent.
* **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Allows new users to start with minimal or no upfront cost, paying only as they begin to use and derive value from your service.
* **Scalability for Customers:** Pricing scales directly with the customer's usage. As they grow and use more, they pay more; if their usage decreases, their costs also decrease.
* **Value Alignment:** Directly links the cost of your service to the value a customer receives. The more value they get (higher usage), the more they pay.
* **Attracts a Wider Range of Users:** Can appeal to both small users with occasional needs and large users with high consumption.
* **Potential for Higher Revenue from Power Users:** Heavy users contribute proportionally more to revenue.

## When is Usage-Based Pricing a Good Fit?

This model is particularly well-suited for products where usage can be clearly defined, measured, and varies significantly among users. Examples include:

* **API Services:** (e.g., per API call, per data processed, per feature accessed via API).
* **Infrastructure & Platform Services (IaaS/PaaS):** (e.g., per GB of storage, per CPU hour, per database query, per data transfer).
* **Communication Platforms (CPaaS):** (e.g., per message sent/received, per minute of call time, per active user on a call).
* **Data Services & Analytics:** (e.g., per query executed, per gigabyte of data scanned, per report generated).
* **AI & Machine Learning Services:** (e.g., per token processed, per image generated, per model training hour).

## Step-by-Step Guide: Implementing Usage-Based Pricing

Let's implement a usage-based pricing model for an illustrative product: **"PixelVault Cloud API,"** a service that allows developers to store images and process them (e.g., resize, apply filters).

**Our Key Billable Metrics:**
1.  Storage Used (GB per month)
2.  Images Processed (Number of images processed via API)

### Step 1: Define Your Product in ParityDeals

1.  From the side navigation menu, navigate to **Product Catalog > Products**.
2.  Click the **+ Create product** button.
3.  Fill in the product details:
    * **Product name**: `PixelVault Cloud API`
    * **Identifier**: `product-pixelvault-api`
    * **Subscription type**: Select **Single active subscription**.
4.  Click **Create**.

### Step 2: Create Your Billable (Metered) Features

These features will track the consumption of your service.

Navigate to **Product Catalog > Feature entitlements**.

#### Feature A: Storage Consumed

1.  Click **+ Create feature**.
2.  Fill in the details:
    * **Feature name**: `Storage Consumed`
    * **Feature type**: `Meter` > `Raw`
    * **Feature unit**: `GB` / `GBs`
3.  Click **Continue**.
4.  **Define Event Filters**: Your application will need to send events related to storage usage. You might set a filter for an event like `storage.usage.reported`.
5.  **Configure Aggregation**:
    * **Aggregation Method**: `Maximum` (to bill for the peak storage used during the billing period) or `Average` (if that makes more sense for your model).
    * **Over Property**: The property in your event that contains the storage amount (e.g., `gb_used`).
6.  Click **Create**.
#### Feature B: Images Processed

1.  Click **+ Create feature**.
2.  Fill in the details:
    * **Feature name**: `Images Processed`
    * **Feature type**: `Meter` > `Raw`
    * **Feature unit**: `Image` / `Images`
3.  Click **Continue**.
4.  **Define Event Filters**: Filter for an event like `image.processed`.
5.  **Configure Aggregation**:
    * **Aggregation Method**: `Count` (if each event represents one image processed) or `Sum` (if an event includes an `image_count` property).
6.  Click **Create**.

### Step 3: Design Your Usage-Based Plan

For this guide, we'll create a single plan focused purely on usage. You could also create plans with a small base fee plus usage charges.

Navigate to your **PixelVault Cloud API** product page.


#### 1. Create the Plan
1.  On the product page, click **+ Create plan**.
2.  Enter details:
    * **Plan name**: `Pay-as-you-go API`
    * **Description**: `Flexible access to PixelVault API. Pay only for what you use.`
3.  Click **Create**.
    

#### 2. Configure Pricing
1.  On the `Pay-as-you-go API` plan page, click **Set price**.
2.  Select **Paid**.
3.  On the **"Billing cycle"** screen, you must select a cycle. Choose **Monthly** and click **Continue**.
4.  On the **"Charges"** screen:
    * **Do not add a "Fixed Charge"** if you want a purely usage-based plan. (Alternatively, you could add a small base fee here for API access, e.g., $5/month). For this example, we'll skip it.

5.  **Add Usage-Based Charge for "Storage Consumed"**:
    * Click **Add usage-based charges**.
    * Choose the **Storage Consumed** feature.
    * Select **Prepaid commitment** or **Pay-as-you-go** based on whether you want upfront payment for expected usage or billing in arrears. For typical API usage, **Pay-as-you-go** is common.
    * For "Pricing model," select **Tiered**.
    * **Configure the tiers:**
        * Tier 1: `First unit: 0`, `Last unit: 100` (GB), `Unit price: $0.10` (per GB)
        * Tier 2: `First unit: 101`, `Last unit: 1000` (GB), `Unit price: $0.08` (per GB)
        * Tier 3: `First unit: 1001`, `Last unit: Unlimited` (GB), `Unit price: $0.05` (per GB)
    * Click **Add**.
    

6.  **Add Usage-Based Charge for "Images Processed"**:
    * Click **Add usage-based charges** again.
    * Choose the **Images Processed** feature.
    * Select **Pay-as-you-go**.
    * For "Pricing model," select **Per-unit**.
    * **Unit price**: `$0.01` (per image processed).
    * Click **Add**.
   

7.  **Save** the pricing configuration.
8.  Finally, **Publish** the plan.

### Step 4: (Optional) Offer a Free Tier or Initial Credits

* **Free Tier with Limits:** You could create a separate "Free" plan with very limited, hard-capped usage of these features (e.g., 1 GB storage, 100 images processed free per month).
* **Initial Credits:** As an alternative to a trial, you could grant new sign-ups a small, one-time package of "processing credits" using the package pricing model on a separate feature.

### Step 5: Design the Pricing Table and Activate

1.  Navigate to **Monetization > Pricing table** and design a pricing table to present your `Pay-as-you-go API` plan. Clearly list the per-unit or tiered rates for each billable metric.
  
2.  Navigate to **Monetization > Offerings** and create an offering, linking your pricing table and the `PixelVault Cloud API` product.
3.  Use the generated **Offering ID** in your application to display the pricing and allow sign-ups.

## Key Considerations for Usage-Based Pricing

* **Preventing Bill Shock:** Provide tools for customers to monitor their usage in real-time. Consider setting up alerts when they approach certain thresholds.
* **Clarity and Predictability:** Make your pricing extremely easy to understand. Customers should be able to estimate their potential costs.
* **Usage Tracking Accuracy:** Ensure your event tracking and aggregation are robust and accurate.
* **Choosing the Right Metrics:** Bill on metrics that customers clearly understand and perceive as valuable.
* **Setting Rates:** Research competitors and understand your costs to set rates that are both attractive to customers and sustainable for your business.
