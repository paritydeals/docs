title: "Pricing Flow Use Case: Autonomous AI Task Agents"
description: "A step-by-step guide to configuring a hybrid pricing model for AI agents using ParityDeals, combining subscription tiers with usage-based charges."
---

This guide outlines how to set up a pricing flow for a product offering "Autonomous AI Task Agents." These agents might perform tasks like data research, automated customer responses, or process automation. The pricing model will include tiered subscriptions that grant access to a specific number of agents and a baseline number of tasks, with overages for additional tasks.

---

## Why This Hybrid Model is Useful for AI Agents

This pricing structure offers several benefits:

* **Predictable Base Costs:** Customers know their minimum monthly spend based on the subscription tier, which helps with budgeting.
* **Scalability:** As users rely more on the agents (more tasks executed), the pricing scales accordingly, aligning cost with value.
* **Value Alignment:** Customers pay for the work the agents actually perform (tasks) beyond a generous included amount.
* **Tiered Access to Capabilities:** Allows for different levels of service, such as a higher number of deployable agents or access to premium features in higher tiers.
* **Lower Barrier to Entry:** A basic tier with an included task quota can attract users who want to start small and test the service.

## Step 2: Create Billable Features

Define the core components that determine pricing and usage.

Navigate to **Product Catalog > Feature entitlements**.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Feature A: Active Agent Slots (Customizable)">

    * `[Image: "Create feature" modal for "Active Agent Slots" with "Customizable" type selected.]`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Feature B: Tasks Executed (Metered)">
This feature tracks the number of tasks completed by the AI agents. This will be our primary usage metric for overages.
