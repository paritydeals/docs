A time-based trial allows potential customers to access a specific plan (or the entire product) for a limited duration (e.g., 7, 14, or 30 days) without an upfront payment. At the end of the trial, they can choose to subscribe to a paid plan, be downgraded, or have their access end.

## Why Use Time-Based Trials? The Benefits

Offering a time-based trial can significantly impact your customer acquisition and conversion funnels:

* **Reduces Barrier to Entry:** Users can experience your product's value firsthand without immediate financial commitment.
* **Increases Conversions:** A positive trial experience is a strong motivator for users to upgrade to a paid plan.
* **Showcases Premium Features:** Allows users to test out the full capabilities of your paid tiers, understanding the benefits they would be paying for.
* **Gathers User Feedback:** The trial period is an excellent opportunity to collect feedback from engaged users about your product and onboarding process.
* **Qualifies Leads:** Users who actively engage during a trial are often more qualified and likely to become long-term customers.
* **Drives Urgency:** A limited-time trial encourages users to explore the product actively within a defined timeframe.

## Common Use Cases for Time-Based Trials

Here are several ways you can leverage time-based trials:

1.  **Standard SaaS Free Trial:** Offer a 7, 14, or 30-day free trial of your core paid plans (e.g., "Starter," "Pro") to all new sign-ups.
2.  **New Feature Promotion:** Grant existing users on lower tiers a temporary trial of a higher-tier plan that includes a newly launched premium feature.
3.  **Upgrade Incentive:** Offer a trial of a more advanced plan to users who might be hitting the limits of their current plan.
4.  **Win-Back Campaigns:** Offer a trial to previously subscribed users who churned, showcasing new improvements or features.
5.  **Event/Campaign-Specific Trials:** Run marketing campaigns offering special, perhaps longer, trial periods for a limited time.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up a Time-Based Trial

Let's walk through setting up a common scenario: **Offering a 14-day free trial for a "Starter Plan."**

**Prerequisites:**
* You have already created a **Product** (e.g., "My Awesome App").
* You have an existing **Paid Plan** (e.g., "Starter Plan") configured with its standard recurring charges.

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Plan's Pricing Configuration

1.  From the side navigation menu, go to **Product Catalog > Products**.
2.  Select the Product that contains the plan you want to offer a trial for.
3.  In the "Plans" section of the Product page, find your "Starter Plan" and click on it to open its details.
4.  Click on **Set price** (or **Edit price** if pricing is already configured for the plan).

### Step 2: Enable and Configure the Free Trial

1.  You'll be in the pricing configuration modal for your "Starter Plan".
2.  Locate the checkbox labeled **Provide free trial** and check it. [cite: 122]
3.  Once checked, options for the trial duration will appear.
    * In the **Trial period** field, enter `14`.
    * From the dropdown next to it, select `days`. [cite: 122]

### Step 3: Configure Post-Trial Actions

Decide what happens when the 14-day trial ends if the user hasn't provided a payment method or actively subscribed.

1.  You will see options like: "Pause, cancel, or downgrade subscription if trial ends without payment method." [cite: 122]
2.  Select the desired outcome from the available choices[cite: 123]:
    * **Downgrade to free plan:** Automatically moves the user to a predefined free plan.
    * **Pause subscription:** Pauses their access until they provide payment.
    * **Cancel subscription:** Terminates their access.

### Step 4: Save and Publish

1.  Once you have configured the trial period and post-trial actions, click **Save** (or the primary action button to save the pricing configuration).
2.  If the plan (or these changes) haven't been published yet, make sure to **Publish** the plan so the trial offer becomes active.

Your "Starter Plan" will now offer a 14-day free trial to new subscribers of that plan.

## Important Considerations for Time-Based Trials

* **Clear Communication:** Ensure your users clearly understand the trial terms: its duration, what's included, and what happens when it ends. Use your website, in-app messages, and emails for this.
* **Onboarding During Trial:** A good trial experience often involves effective onboarding to help users discover the product's value quickly.
* **Trial Expiry Notifications:** Remind users before their trial expires, encouraging them to add a payment method or choose a plan.
* **Data & Analytics:** Track trial sign-ups, engagement, conversion rates, and feedback to optimize your trial strategy.
