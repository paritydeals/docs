## What is a Product?

In ParityDeals, a **Product** is a broad offering or product family that you provide to your customers. It acts as a high-level container that encompasses all of its related components, such as different pricing **Plans**, optional **Add-ons**, and the specific **Features** included in each.

Before you can define what your customers will pay for, you first need to create a Product.

## Creating a Product

Follow these steps to create your first product. Once created, you can see all your products in a list.

1.  **Navigate to the Products Page**
    From the main sidebar, go to **Product Catalog > Products**.

2.  **Start Product Creation**
    Click the **"+ Create product"** button, located in the top-right corner.

3.  **Enter Product Details**
    A form will appear asking for the following information:
    - **Name:** The public name of your product (e.g., "Timemaster" or "Lightgallery").
    - **ID:** An identifier for the product. This will be auto-generated by ParityDeals, but you can override it.
    - **Description (optional):** A brief internal description of the product.

    <Warning>
      **Using the Product ID**

      The `ID` is a unique key used to reference this product in your application's codebase via our API or SDKs. To link a product in ParityDeals to an existing product in your own system, you can override the auto-generated `ID` with your existing one.
    </Warning>

4.  **Confirm Creation**
    Click the **"Create"** button to finalize the product.

5.  **Success!**
    You will see a success message, and you will be taken to the product's detail page. You are now ready to define its pricing.

## Next Steps: Modeling Your Pricing

Now that your product is created, you are ready to package its functionality into **Plans** and **Add-ons**.

From the product's detail screen, you can create and manage these pricing components. This view also serves as a preview of the pricing tables that your customers will see on your website or in your app.

ParityDeals supports all billing periods, including weekly, monthly, yearly, and even lifetime deals. When multiple billing periods are defined for a plan, they are neatly organized into tabs for your customers.
