## Overview

With ParityDeals' flexible pricing and packaging, you can quickly configure any business model and iterate over time. Our platform grows with you, providing first-class support for both product-led growth and self-serve motions.

## The Product Catalog

The Product Catalog is the central hub where you will find and manage your product families, plans, add-ons, and features.

### Products

A **Product** represents a product family you offer to customers. It encompasses all related plans, features, and pricing.

### Plans

A **Plan** defines how you package and monetize your product. Each plan has a specific **pricing model** and includes a set of **features** that customers are entitled to when they subscribe. The model can be a simple flat fee, per-user, or based on consumption.

### Features

**Features** are the specific entitlements or privileges that control a user's access to your application's functionality. They are the configurable parts of your application that you can monetize.

In ParityDeals, features allow you to precisely manage customer access based on their subscription.
