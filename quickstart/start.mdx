## Overview

With ParityDeals' flexible pricing and packaging, you can quickly configure any business model and iterate over time. Our platform grows with you, providing first-class support for both product-led growth and self-serve motions.

## The Product Catalog

The Product Catalog is the central hub where you will find and manage your product families, plans, add-ons, and features.

### Products

A **Product** represents a product family you offer to customers. It encompasses all related plans, features, and pricing.

### Plans

A **Plan** defines how you package and monetize your product. Each plan has a specific **pricing model** and includes a set of **features** that customers are entitled to when they subscribe. The model can be a simple flat fee, per-user, or based on consumption.

### Features

**Features** are distinct pieces of functionality in your product that can be packaged, monetized, and controlled. They are the core capabilities that you offer to your users. Think of features as the “nouns” of your product.


#### Entitlements

**Entitlements** are the rules that grant features to a customer as part of a Plan. They define how a plan gets access to features—whether they are turned on or off, or available up to a certain limit.
