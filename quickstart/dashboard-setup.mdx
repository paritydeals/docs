title: 'Dashboard setup'
---

Before you can integrate ParityDeals into your app, you need to configure your **products, plans, and features** in the dashboard.  
This setup defines how your pricing and entitlements will work.

---

## Create a product

1. In the sidebar, go to **Products → Create product**  
2. Enter a product name (e.g., “Pro SaaS App”)  
3. Click **Save** — you’ll be redirected to the product page  

---

## Create a plan

From the product page:  

1. Click **Create plan**  
2. Enter a plan name (e.g., “Basic Plan”)  
3. Click **Save** — you’ll be redirected to the plan details page  

---

## Add pricing to the plan

You can add fixed pricing or usage-based pricing (for metered features).  
For now, let’s set up fixed pricing:

1. In the plan page, click **Set price**  
2. Select **Paid**  
3. Choose a billing cycle (e.g., Monthly)  
4. Select the **Fixed charges** pricing type  
5. Enter a price (e.g., $10)  
6. (Optional) Enable free trial  
7. Click **Save** — you’ll be redirected back to the plan details page  

---

## Add features to the plan

Scroll down to the **Entitlements** section.  

1. Click **Add feature**  
2. A modal will open where you can create features  
3. Create your features (see below), then click **Add feature**  

### Features overview

Features are created independently and can be attached to multiple plans with different values.  
There are three types:

- **Switch (Boolean)** — on or off.  
  Examples: custom branding, priority support, analytics access  

- **Customizable** — a fixed numeric limit, no usage reporting.  
  Examples: data retention days (7, 30, 365), max upload size (10 MB, 100 MB, 1 GB)  

- **Metered** — tracked consumption, usage events sent to ParityDeals, resets each billing cycle.  
  Examples: API calls per month, AI tokens processed, data transferred, emails sent  

👉 For now, add one Boolean feature and one Metered feature. We’ll show you how to check access and track usage with the SDK later.  

4. Once created, you’ll see features listed on the left side of the screen  
5. Click the **+ (plus)** icon to attach a feature to the plan  
6. Enter a value for the feature and click **Add**  
7. The feature will now appear on the right side of the screen under the plan  
8. Close the dialog — you’ll return to the plan details page  

---

## Publish the plan

The last step is to publish your plan to Stripe.  

1. Click **Publish**  
2. If your Stripe account is not connected, you’ll be asked to connect  
3. Click **Connect**, sign in to Stripe, and authorize the connection  
4. Back in ParityDeals, click **Publish** again — the plan is now live and customers can subscribe to it.

Next, you can integrate ParityDeals into your app:

- Embed a pricing page with the **Pricing Table widget**  
- Create a customer in ParityDeals when a user signs up in your app  
- Use the ParityDeals **SDK** to check feature access and track usage
