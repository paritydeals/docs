## Overview

The ParityDeals Node SDK provides a convenient way to interact with the ParityDeals REST APIs from your Node application.


Installation
Install the ParityDeals SDK using npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install @paritydeals/node-sdk
```
or

```shell
yarn add @paritydeals/node-sdk
```


## Prerequisites

Before you can initialize the client and use the SDK methods, you need a Server API Key.

You can obtain this key from the ParityDeals application:

    1. Navigate to Settings.
    2. Go to the [Developers](https://app.paritydeals.com/settings/developers) section.
    3. Copy the Server API Key.

Once copied, add this key to your environment variables or directly in your code (though environment variables are recommended for security).


```typescript
# Example of setting it in your code (ensure you handle this securely)
ACCESS_TOKEN = "__YOUR_API_KEY__"
```


## Configuring the Client

The SDK provides a main `ParityDeals` client class. You instantiate it directly with your configuration options.


```typescript

const ACCESS_TOKEN: string = "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN";
```


#### How to Create a Client


```typescript
import { ParityDeals } from '@paritydeals/node-sdk';

const client = new ParityDeals({ accessToken: ACCESS_TOKEN });

```





## Supported Functionalities

The SDK currently supports the following operations:

    1. [Customers](/api-reference/backend-integration/node-sdk#customers)

    2. [Checkout](/api-reference/backend-integration/node-sdk#checkout)

    3. [Entitlements](/api-reference/backend-integration/node-sdk#entitlements)

    4. [Reporting](/api-reference/backend-integration/node-sdk#reporting)

    5. [Subscriptions](/api-reference/backend-integration/node-sdk#subscriptions)


Further details on each method, including parameters and return values, should be added under each functionality.

## Customers

The `customers` module allows you to manage customer records within ParityDeals. You can access these operations via the `customers` attribute on an initialized `ParityDeals` client instance.

---

### Creates a new customer

```typescript
const newCustomer = await client.customers.create({
    customerId: "unique-customer-id-789",
    email: "new.node.customer@example.com",
    name: "Node SDK User",
    metadata: { source: "sdk_import", priority: "high" }
});
```

<Accordion title="Response">
```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef", // Server-generated UUID
  "customerId": "unique-customer-id-789",
  "name": "Node SDK Use",
  "email": "new.node.customer@example.com",
  "details": {}, // Or any server-added details
  "metadata": {
    "source": "sdk_import",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  "createdOn": "2025-06-04T06:03:30.195790Z",
  "modifiedOn": "2025-06-04T06:03:30.195831Z"
}
```
</Accordion>

**Required Parameters:**

* `customerId` : A unique identifier for the customer that you define. This ID will be used to reference the customer in subsequent API calls.

**Optional Parameters:**

* `email` : The email address of the customer. Must be a valid email format.
* `name` : The name of the customer.
* `metadata` : A dictionary of custom key-value pairs to store additional information about the customer.

### Updates an existing customer

This operation performs a partial update (PATCH), so you only need to provide the fields you want to change.



```typescript
const updatedCustomer = await client.customers.update({
  customerId: "unique-customer-id-789",

This operation creates a new checkout session for a customer, allowing them to proceed with a purchase or subscription.


```typescript
import { ParityDeals, CHARGE_PERIOD_CHOICES } from '@paritydeals/node-sdk';

const response = await client.checkout.createSession({
  planIdentifier: "plan-pro-monthly",
  chargePeriod: CHARGE_PERIOD_CHOICES.MONTHLY,

## Entitlements

The entitlements module allows you to check and retrieve customer entitlements for various features. These operations target a specific edge API endpoint (https://edge.api.paritydeals.com by default) and use the GET HTTP method with query parameters.


### Checks if a specific customer has access to a particular feature.
This method directly returns a boolean indicating access status.


```typescript
const hasAccess = await client.entitlements.hasAccess({
      customerId: "cust_node_ent_123",
      featureId: "premium-reporting-node"
    });
```

<Accordion title="Response">

  ```shell
   True
  ```
</Accordion>

**Required Parameters**:

    * `customerId` : The unique identifier for the customer.

    * `featureId` : The unique identifier for the feature whose access is being checked.

**Returns**:

    * `bool`: True if the customer has access to the specified feature (considering feature type, limits, etc.), False otherwise or if the feature is not found in their entitlements.



### Retrieves the detailed entitlement information for a specific feature for a given customer.


```typescript
const response = await client.entitlements.getEntitlement({
    customerId: "cust_node_ent_123",
    featureId: "premium-reporting-node"
});

## Reporting

### Reporting pre-aggregated usages for customer

This endpoint is used for reporting the pre-aggregated feature usage from your application (client-level) to the ParityDeals application. It allows you to update the usage count for a specific feature associated with a customer.



```typescript
import { BEHAVIOUR_CHOICES } from '@paritydeals/node-sdk';

const response = await client.reporting.reportUsage({
    value: 150,
    customerId: "customer_001",
    featureId: "seats",
    behaviour: BEHAVIOUR_CHOICES.SET
});
```


<Accordion title="Response">

    * `value`: The usage value being reported.

    * `customerId` : The unique identifier for the customer associated with this usage.

    * `featureId` : The unique identifier for the feature for which usage is being reported.

    * `behaviour` parameter dictates how the usage is updated:

        * `SET`: This will replace the current usage value for the feature with the new `value` provided.

        * `DELTA`: This will increment the existing usage value for the feature by the amount specified in the `value` parameter


**Returns**:

An instance of ReportUsageResponse (Pydantic model), which includes:

    * `value`: The usage value that was recorded.

    * `customerId` : The customer ID associated with the usage.

    * `featureId` : The feature Identifier for which usage was recorded.

    * `eventName` : An internal event name generated by the server for this usage report (e.g., "aggregated.usage").

    * `idempotencyKey` : A unique idempotency key generated by the server for this specific usage report instance.

    * `timestamp` : The server-generated UTC timestamp (str format) indicating when the usage report was processed.


{/* ### Reporting raw events for customer */}

{/* Raw events are primarily used for metered billing scenarios, particularly when a customer is subscribed to a plan with usage-based billing (often referred to as "pay as you go"). Each event reported can contribute to the billable usage for that customer. */}


{/* ```typescript */}
{/* import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'; */}
{/* const timestampStr = new Date().toISOString().replace('T', ' ').replace('Z', '').padEnd(26, '0').slice(0, 26); */}

{/* const response = await client.reporting.reportEvent({ */}
