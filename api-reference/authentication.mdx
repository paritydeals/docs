title: 'Authentication'

ParityDeals API uses API keys to authenticate requests. All API requests must be made over HTTPS; calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## API Keys

ParityDeals provides two types of API keys for different use cases.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Client API Key">
    Used for frontend applications where the key is publicly accessible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Server API Key">
    Used for backend implementations. This key has more privileges and must be kept secret.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Environment Scoping:** API keys are scoped per environment. This means your **production** and **sandbox** environments will have separate and distinct API keys.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Important Security Notice:** Do not share your **Server API Key** in any publicly accessible areas such as frontend code, client-side applications, or public repositories.
</Warning>

### Obtaining Your API Key

You can get your API key from the ParityDeals application dashboard.

1.  Navigate to **Settings**.
2.  Go to the [**Developers**](https://app.paritydeals.com/settings/developers) section.
3.  Copy your **Server API Key** to use in your application.

## Authorization

To authenticate your requests, pass your **Server API Key** as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
