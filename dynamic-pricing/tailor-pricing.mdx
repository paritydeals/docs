description: "Learn how to use Targeting Rules in ParityDeals to create dynamic pricing strategies based on customer attributes like location, PPP, device, and more."

ParityDeals' **Targeting Rules** empower you to implement sophisticated, dynamic pricing strategies. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, you can tailor the price of your products and plans based on specific customer attributes, ensuring fairness, competitiveness, and optimized revenue across diverse audience segments.

Whether you want to adjust prices based on geographic location, economic indicators, or the technology your customers use, Targeting Rules provide the flexibility to present the right price to the right user at the right time.

## How Targeting Rules Work

1.  **Define Conditions:** You set up rules based on customer attributes such as:
    * `PPP group` (e.g., Developing regions, Emerging markets)
    * `Country` (e.g., India, Brazil, Germany)
    * `Platform / OS` (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows)
    * `Browser` (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
2.  **Set the Action:** If a customer's attributes match your defined conditions, a pricing adjustment is applied, such as:
    * Decreasing the price by a percentage.
    * Increasing the price by a percentage.
    * (Potentially other actions like setting a fixed override, depending on system capabilities).
3.  **A/B Test (Optional):** Create multiple variants within a rule to test different adjustments and allocate audience percentages to measure impact.

## Activating Targeting Rules

A Targeting Rule is inactive until it's connected to an **Offering**. An Offering makes your product (with its associated rules) available to your users.

1.  **Navigate to Offerings:**
    * Go to **Monetization > Offerings**.
2.  **Create or Edit an Offering:**
    * Click **+ Create offering**.
3.  **Link the Targeting Rule:**
    * In the "Create offering" (or "Edit offering") modal, choose to offer your product via a **Targeting rule**.
    * From the dropdown, select the specific rule you want to activate.
4.  **Save/Create the Offering:**
    * Click **Create** (or "Update"). You will get an **Offering ID**.
5.  **Integrate:** Use this Offering ID in your application to present the dynamically priced product to your users.

## Important Considerations for All Targeting Rules

* **Accuracy of Data:** The effectiveness of these rules depends on the accuracy of the underlying data used for targeting (e.g., Geo-IP data, device detection).
* **VPN Usage:** For geo-targeting, be aware that users might use VPNs. Consider your policy on this.
* **Transparency:** Clearly communicate your pricing policies. While dynamic pricing can be powerful, customers value transparency.
* **Legal & Tax Implications:** Different prices in different regions or for different segments can have varying legal and tax consequences. Consult with experts.
* **Maintenance:** Regularly review and update your rules as market conditions, your product, or your strategies change.
* **Rule Priority/Conflicts:** If multiple rules could apply to a single user, understand how ParityDeals handles rule priority or conflicts to ensure predictable pricing. (This information would typically be found in advanced ParityDeals documentation).
