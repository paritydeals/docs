title: "Stripe buy now button"
description: "The ParityDeals buy now button enhances Stripe's system by creating dynamic payment links that adjust prices based on user location, holidays, and other criteria set in ParityDeals."
---


### Overview
To integrate ParityDeals with Stripe, replace your existing Stripe checkout link with the corresponding ParityDeals buy now button on your website. For security reasons, this link functions only when accessed directly from the specified website.


### Parameters
- **`payment_id`** (required): The unique identifier for the product on Stripe.
- **`product_id`** (required): The ParityDeals product identifier used to apply specific pricing and discounts.
- **`success_url`** (required): The URL to which a user will be redirected after a successful purchase.

### Behavior
- **Geographic Pricing**: When a user accesses the checkout page via the generated buy-now link, the API automatically fetches and applies pricing based on the user's location, holidays and other criteria set in ParityDeals. For example, if the product is priced at `$100` in the US and `$50` in India, a user from India will see the price as `$50` at checkout.

### Example Usage
Here is how you can construct a URL for integrating the API with a buy-now button on a website:

```tsx
<a 
  href="https://www.paritydeals.com/api/v1/stripe-buy-now/?payment_id=plink_1Q0iiSLN3QPLtCqeBFPkbiay
  &product_id=promo_c1a4e298186d439586d78l20b2d98b80
  &success_url=https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/"
>Buy Now</a>
```
