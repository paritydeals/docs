## What are ParityDeals Pricing tables?

ParityDeals' Pricing tables are dynamic, remotely configurable interfaces that present your pricing plans and features to your customers. They are the crucial touchpoint where users make subscription decisions. Our Pricing tables empower you to design, build, and deploy your entire pricing presentation—from simple pricing tables to complex, interactive subscription flows—directly from the ParityDeals dashboard, minimizing the need for code changes or app updates for most modifications.

Key benefits include:
* **Remote Configuration:** Update your pricing table's appearance, content, and even the plans displayed, directly from the ParityDeals dashboard.
* **No-Code for Most Changes:** Iterate on your pricing display rapidly. Most visual and content changes are reflected instantly without engineering intervention.
* **Dynamic Pricing Display:** Any modifications to your underlying pricing models (plans, features, prices) are automatically reflected in your pricing tables, ensuring consistency.
* **Experimentation Ready:** Easily A/B test different pricing table designs, plan presentations, and promotional content to optimize conversion.

## Getting Started with Pricing tables

You build and manage your pricing tables within the ParityDeals Dashboard.

1.  From the main sidebar, navigate to **Monetization > Pricing tables**.
2.  On the Pricing tables page, you can see a list of your existing pricing tables or create a new one by clicking the **"+ Create Pricing Table"** button. You can start from one of our pre-built templates or design a completely custom experience from scratch.

## The Pricing table Editor

The Pricing table editor is your central hub for designing and configuring every aspect of your pricing table. It is organized into three main tabs: Configuration, Content, and Appearance.

<Frame>
    <img height="200" src="/images/pricing-table-editor.png" />
</Frame> 

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Configuration">
    This tab focuses on the foundational settings, linking your pricing table to your product catalog and defining core display and localization rules.

    #### Connecting Your Product
    First, you must associate your pricing table with the product whose plans and features it will display.
    * **Product Connection:** From the dropdown menu, select the relevant product from your catalog. This action dynamically links the pricing table to that product's specific set of plans and features.

        <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/configuration-tab.png" />
        </Frame> 

    #### Price & Feature Display Settings
    Control how detailed information about pricing and features is presented to the user.
    * **Display Prices & Features:** This toggle (enabled by default) determines if the detailed pricing information (e.g., price per month) and the lists of features associated with each plan are shown on the pricing table.
    * **Show Feature Description Tooltip:** When enabled, an info icon (ⓘ) will appear next to features in the plan list. Hovering over this icon will display a tooltip containing the feature's description (as defined in your Product Catalog).
    
    #### Localization & Formatting
    Configure how pricing information is adapted for different locales and user preferences.
    * **Localize Pricing:** This toggle (disabled by default) enables ParityDeals to attempt displaying prices in the user's local currency, based on their region.
    * **Decimal Places:** Choose the number of decimal places to display for prices (e.g., `0` for `$10`, `1` for `$10.0`, `2` for `$10.00`).
    * **Decimal Separator:** Select the character used as the decimal separator (e.g., Dot `.` for `$10.00` or Comma `,` for `$10,00`).
    * **Price Rounding:** Define how prices are rounded if they result in fractions after currency conversion or specific calculations:
        * `Ceiling`: Always rounds up to the next whole number (e.g., `4.2` becomes `5`).
        * `Floor`: Always rounds down to the previous whole number (e.g., `4.2` becomes `4`).
        * `Round to nearest`: Rounds to the closest whole number (e.g., `4.2` ≈ `4`, `4.6` ≈ `5`).

        <img height="200" src="/images/configuration-localization.png" />
        </Frame> 
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="2. Content">
    This tab empowers you to customize all visible text, manage the order and visibility of plans and features, and add promotional elements to drive conversions.

    #### General Pricing table Content
    Update the main textual elements such as titles, subtitles, or descriptive paragraphs. You can also inject marketing labels or badges to highlight specific deals or plans.
    * **Example:** Add a "Save 20% with Annual Billing ✨" badge next to your annual plan toggle, or include a "Most Popular!" banner on your recommended plan.

        <img height="200" src="/images/content-editor.png" />
        </Frame> 
    #### Managing Plans in the Pricing table
    The plans linked from your selected product are automatically listed. You have full control over their presentation:
    * **Ordering:** Simply drag and drop plans to change their sequence in the pricing table. This allows you to prioritize the plans you want users to see first.
        <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/managing-plans-ordering.png" />
        </Frame> 
    * **Visibility:** Click the three-dot menu on any plan card and select **"Hide"** to remove it from this specific pricing table. The plan remains active in your product catalog but will not be visible in this pricing table instance.
        <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/managing-plans-visibility.png" />
        </Frame> 
    * **Editing Display Properties:** Click the three-dot menu and select **"Edit"** to modify how the plan is presented:
        * **Plan Name & Description:** Override the default name and description (sourced from the Product Catalog) specifically for this pricing table.
        * **Highlight Plan:** Toggle this option to visually emphasize a plan, perhaps with a distinct border, background color, or a "Recommended" badge. This is effective for guiding users towards your preferred or best-value option.

        </Frame>
    #### Managing Features within Plans
    Within each plan's edit mode (accessed as described above), you can also customize how its included features are displayed:
    * **Ordering:** Drag and drop features within a plan's list to change their sequence for that plan, as displayed on this pricing table.
        <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/reordering-features.png" />
        </Frame>        
    * **Editing Display Text:** Click the three-dot menu next to any feature in the list and select **"Edit"** to customize its presentation:
        * **Customer Display Text:** Modify the primary label for the feature. For example, change an internal feature ID like `api_calls_v2_monthly` to a user-friendly "Monthly API Requests".
        * **Tooltip Description:** Add or edit the detailed text that appears in a tooltip when a user hovers over the info icon next to the feature.
        <Tip>The original default text (from the feature's settings in the Product Catalog) for both these fields is shown at the bottom of the form. This allows you to easily reference or revert to the original copy if needed.</Tip>

        <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/managing-features-editing.png" />
        </Frame>  
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="3. Appearance">
    This tab gives you comprehensive control over the visual styling of your pricing table, enabling you to perfectly align it with your brand identity and create an appealing user experience.

    #### Branding & Styling
    * **Colors:** Use color pickers or input hex codes to customize Background color, Primary color (often used for CTAs and highlights), Primary text color, Secondary text color, CTA text color, and Border colors.
        <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/appearance-colors.png" />
        </Frame>          
    * **Typography:** Define the Font family for your pricing table (e.g., Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, or custom fonts). Set specific styles (font size, weight, line height) for different text elements like H1, H2, H3, Paragraph 1 (P1), and Paragraph 2 (P2).
        <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/appearance-typography.png" />
        </Frame>       
        * **Layout:** Adjust general layout properties like overall Alignment (left, center, right), maximum Width of the pricing table, and Margin and Padding for various components to control spacing.
        <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/appearance-layout.png" />
        </Frame>  
    #### Custom CSS
    For highly specific styling needs that go beyond the built-in options, you can add your own custom CSS rules. This allows for virtually unlimited styling flexibility.

## Connecting Pricing tables to Offerings

Once your pricing table is designed and saved, it doesn't automatically appear to users. You need to link it to an **Offering** to control who sees it and under what conditions.

### What is an Offering?

An **Offering** in ParityDeals is a powerful entity that determines precisely what pricing table (and therefore which set of plans and pricing) a specific user or user segment is presented with. Offerings are the bridge between your pricing table designs and your live application. They enable you to:
* Remotely control the entire pricing table experience without deploying new code.
* Define a specific set of packages (plans) and associated metadata that are shown on a pricing table.
* Implement dynamic pricing strategies by linking pricing tables to **Targeting Rules**. This allows you to show different pricing tables and pricing to different users based on attributes like their geographic location (for PPP pricing), device type, or other custom criteria.
* Link pricing tables directly to specific products for simpler, non-targeted scenarios.

Targeting Rules will be discussed in detail in their own documentation section. Here, we'll focus on creating a basic Offering to link your pricing table directly to a product.


### Creating an Offering for Your Pricing table

1.  From the main sidebar, navigate to **Monetization > Offerings**.
2.  Click the **"+ Create offering"** button.
      <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/create-offering.png" />
    </Frame>  
3.  In the "Create offering" modal that appears:
    * **Select Pricing table:** From the dropdown menu, choose the pricing table you just designed and configured.
    * **Assign to:** You have two primary options for how this offering will be used:
        * **Product:** Select this option to link the offering (and its associated pricing table) directly to a single product. Choose your desired product from the "Select Product" dropdown. This is the most straightforward way to deploy a pricing table for a specific product.
        * **Targeting Rule:** (This will be covered in detail in the "Targeting Rules" documentation). Selecting this allows you to associate the offering with a predefined rule, enabling dynamic presentation based on customer segments (e.g., for regional pricing like PPP).

     <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/create-offering-select-pricing-table.png" />
    </Frame> 

4.  Click **"Create"**.

### Using the Offering ID
The most crucial piece of information for integration is the **Offering ID**.
Once you hit **Create**, the modal will display the **Offering ID** — this is the key you'll need to copy and paste directly into your codebase to complete the integration.
You can always retrieve the Offering ID later from the **Offering list** page.

     <Frame>
        <img height="200" src="/images/offering-id-application.png" />
    </Frame>  
* This `Offering ID` must be pasted into your application's code where you initialize the ParityDeals SDK or when you render the pricing table component. The ID tells your application which specific Offering (and therefore which pricing table configuration, plans, and pricing) to fetch and display to the end-user.
