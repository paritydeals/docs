## What are Targeting Rules?

Targeting Rules in ParityDeals are a sophisticated feature designed to empower you to present **specific Offerings (which include unique dynamic pricing based on PPP groups, country) to distinct customer segments.** By defining rules based on customer attributes, you can tailor your pricing and product presentation dynamically, ensuring the right customers see the most relevant and effective offers.

This powerful capability allows you to:
* **Implement Granular Pricing Strategies:** Based on customer behavior, demographics, or geographic location.
* **Maximize Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** By optimizing pricing for different segments.
* **Enhance Paywall Effectiveness:** By showing more relevant plans and pricing, increasing conversion rates.

Supported attributes for creating these rules include:
* **Any audience:** A default or catch-all segment.
* **Country:** Target users based on their geographical location.
* **PPP group:** Group countries by Purchasing Power Parity to offer regionally appropriate pricing.
* **Platform / OS:** Target based on the operating system (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows, macOS). (`Coming soon`)
* **Browser:** Target based on the web browser being used (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox). (`Coming soon`)

*[Image: A conceptual diagram illustrating how Targeting Rules work: different user segments (e.g., Segment A from USA, Segment B from India using PPP) are identified by rules, and each segment is directed to a distinct, tailored Offering/Paywall.]*

## Creating and Defining Targeting Rules

You create, view, and manage your Targeting Rules directly from the ParityDeals dashboard.

1.  From the main sidebar navigation, go to **Monetization > Targeting Rules**.
    *[Image: The main ParityDeals navigation sidebar with "Monetization" expanded and "Targeting Rules" highlighted clearly.]*
2.  On the "Targeting Rules" page, click the **"+ Create rule"** button, located in the top-left corner.
    *[Image: The Targeting Rules list page, with an arrow pointing to the "+ Create rule" button. If there are existing rules, they are visible in a list format.]*

This action opens a dedicated page where you will define all aspects of your new rule.

### Step 1: Rule Information

Begin by providing the basic identifying information for your rule. This helps you organize and manage your rules effectively.

* **Rule Name:** Click into the rule name field and enter a clear, descriptive name. This name is for your internal reference.
    * **Example:** "PPP Discount - Tier 3 Countries," "EU Early Adopter Offer," "USA - Standard Pricing."
    *[Image: The "Rule Information" section at the top of the rule creation page, with the "Rule Name" input field highlighted and an example name entered.]*
* **Select Product(s):** Click the dropdown field to choose one or more products from your catalog to which this rule's pricing adjustments will apply. You can search by product name or ID.
    *[Image: The "Select Product(s)" dropdown in the "Rule Information" section, expanded to show a searchable list of products, with one or more products selected.]*

<Info>
A Targeting Rule only becomes active and influences customer experiences once it is connected to an **Offering**.
</Info>

### Step 2: Setting Conditions

This is the core of your Targeting Rule. Here, you define the specific customer attributes that must be met for the rule (and its associated pricing adjustments) to apply.

#### Condition Logic: "If the customer matches..."
1.  Click on the "If the customer matches *" (or similar placeholder text) to begin defining your first condition.
    *[Image: The initial state of the condition builder, highlighting the clickable "If the customer matches *" area to add the first condition.]*
2.  **Select Condition Type:** Choose an attribute from the dropdown menu.
    * **Any audience:** A broad condition for setting a default rule that applies if no other more specific rule matches a user.
    * **Country:** Target users based on their geographic location, detected via IP address.
    * **PPP group:** Target users based on the Purchasing Power Parity of their country.
    * **Platform / OS:** (`Coming soon`)
    * **Browser:** (`Coming soon`)
    *[Image: The 'Condition Type' dropdown expanded, showing options like 'Any audience', 'Country', 'PPP group', etc., with one option highlighted.]*
3.  **Select Operator:** Choose how the condition should evaluate the selected attribute:
    * **`is any of`**: The rule applies if the customer's attribute matches *at least one* of the values you specify. For example, if "Country `is any of` [India, Brazil, Nigeria]," the rule applies if the user is in India OR Brazil OR Nigeria.
    * **`is not any of`**: The rule applies if the customer's attribute does *not match any* of the values you specify. For example, if "Country `is not any of` [USA, Canada]," the rule applies if the user is in any country *except* the USA or Canada.
    *[Image: The operator selection dropdown clearly showing "is any of" and "is not any of" options, with one option selected.]*
4.  **Select Value(s):** Based on the condition type and operator, select the specific values.
    * If you selected "Country," a multi-select dropdown appears where you can search for and choose specific countries.
        *[Image: The value selection UI for "Country," showing a multi-select dropdown with a search bar, a list of countries, and a few countries selected (e.g., India, Brazil).]*
    * If you selected "PPP group," select from predefined PPP groups in the dropdown.
        *[Image: The value selection dropdown for "PPP group," showing example group names like "High PPP," "Mid PPP," "Low PPP / Frontier Markets," with one group selected.]*

#### PPP Groups
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) targeting is a strategic way to offer your product at prices more aligned with local economic conditions, significantly boosting global accessibility and adoption.

* **What they are:** Countries are categorized into groups (tiers) based on their relative purchasing power compared to a benchmark (often the US Dollar). A lower PPP index signifies that the local currency has less purchasing power.
* **Example Groups (Illustrative - groups in ParityDeals are predefined):**
    * **High PPP (e.g., Index 0.7-1.0+):** Includes countries like the USA, Switzerland, Norway, Western European nations, Canada, Australia. (These countries usually receive standard/baseline pricing).
    * **Mid PPP (e.g., Index 0.4-0.69):** May include countries in Southern/Eastern Europe, parts of Latin America, and some Southeast Asian nations. (These countries may receive a moderate discount).
    * **Low PPP / Frontier Markets (e.g., Index 0.2-0.39):** Could include countries like India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and many nations in Africa and other parts of LATAM/SE Asia. (These countries may receive a significant discount).
* **Benefits for SaaS Companies using PPP-based pricing:**
    * **Increased Global Market Penetration:** Access and convert users in developing economies.
    * **Improved Affordability & Higher Adoption Rates:** A lower price barrier leads to more sign-ups and usage.
    * **Enhanced Competitive Advantage:** Offer fairer, more attractive pricing than competitors who use a single global price.
    * **Ethical and Customer-Centric Pricing:** Align the value delivered with local economic realities.

#### Defining Price Adjustments
Once your conditions are set, specify how the pricing should change for customers who match this rule:
1.  From the "Then" section of the condition block, choose either **"Increase price by"** or **"Decrease price by"** from the dropdown menu.
    *[Image: The price adjustment action dropdown within a condition block, showing "Increase price by" and "Decrease price by" options, with one selected.]*
2.  Enter the **percentage** value for the adjustment (e.g., `20` for a 20% change) in the adjacent input field.
    *[Image: The percentage input field next to the price adjustment action, with a value like "20" entered.]*

* **When to use "Decrease price by":**
    * **PPP Adjustments:** To make products more affordable in lower PPP regions.
    * **Promotional Pricing:** To target specific new markets or regions with introductory discounts.
    * **Segment-Specific Offers:** To provide discounts for defined user groups (e.g., educational, non-profit, based on custom attributes if supported).
    * **Benefit:** Increases accessibility, drives adoption in price-sensitive markets, and can boost sales volume.
* **When to use "Increase price by":**
    * **Premium Segments:** If you identify user segments with a higher willingness to pay.
    * **Value-Based Pricing:** For regions where your product offers exceptionally high value or has few local competitors.
    * **Cost Adjustments:** To account for higher operational costs or specific taxes in certain regions if not handled separately.
    * **Benefit:** Optimizes revenue in markets where higher prices are sustainable.

#### Combining Multiple Conditions
You can create highly specific targeting rules by layering multiple conditions.

* **AND Logic:** To add more criteria that *must all be met* for the rule to apply, click the **"+ AND"** button within the same condition block. Each new condition added this way narrows the target segment.
    * **Example:** "If customer is in `PPP Group: Low PPP` **AND** Country `is any of` [India]".
    *[Image: The "+ AND" button within a condition block, highlighted, allowing the addition of another parallel condition.]*
    * **Precedence with AND:** When building complex rules with multiple AND conditions that might appear to overlap (e.g., a country is in a selected PPP group, AND that same country is also specifically targeted with a different adjustment), rules are evaluated based on their defined order or specificity. **It is highly recommended to test complex rule interactions thoroughly to confirm the exact behavior and ensure they produce the desired outcome before activating them for live offerings.**
    *[Image: A condition block clearly showing two AND conditions: the first by "PPP group," and the second by a specific "Country", visually linked to indicate they must both be true.]*

* **OR Logic:** To apply the same price adjustment to several distinct customer segments, click the **"+ Add condition group (OR)"** button. This creates a new, independent block of conditions. The rule will apply if a customer matches *all* conditions in Group 1 **OR** *all* conditions in Group 2, etc.
    * **Example:** "(If Country `is any of` [USA, Canada]) **OR** (If Country `is any of` [UK, Germany] **AND** Browser `is any of` [Chrome])".
    *[Image: The "+ Add condition group (OR)" button highlighted, used to create a separate block of conditions.]*
    *[Image: Two distinct condition groups, labelled "Condition Group 1" and "Condition Group 2", each with their own set of criteria, visually separated by an "OR" indicator.]*

    The evaluation of combined AND/OR conditions follows a structured logic. The diagram below illustrates a simplified flow where a rule applies if either "Condition Group 1" (which itself might contain multiple AND conditions) OR "Condition Group 2" is met:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request Processed] --> B{Match all AND conditions in Group 1?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Rule Applies: Use Group 1 Adjustments]
    B -->|No| D{Match all AND conditions in Group 2?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Rule Applies: Use Group 2 Adjustments]
    D -->|No| F[Evaluate Next OR Group if any...]
    F -->|No further OR groups match| G[Rule Does Not Apply / Default Behavior]
    C --> Z[End Evaluation]
    E --> Z
    G --> Z
```

<Info>
Support for targeting by **Platform / OS** and **Browser** is planned for a future release.
</Info>

#### A/B Testing with Variants (`Coming soon`)
ParityDeals will allow you to create multiple variants within a single Targeting Rule (e.g., Variant A with a 10% discount, Variant B with a 15% discount). This will enable you to A/B test different pricing adjustments for the same customer segment to determine which performs best. This feature is `Coming soon`.

*[Image: A conceptual UI mock-up for A/B test variants (e.g., "Variant A", "Variant B" with different price adjustments) within a targeting rule, clearly marked as "Coming Soon".]*

### Step 3: Creating the Rule

<Warning>
**Crucial Note:** Once a Targeting Rule is created and saved, its **conditions and price adjustments cannot be altered**. This restriction is in place to maintain the integrity and consistency of your analytics and reporting based on these rules. You can, however, edit the rule's name later if needed. Therefore, please plan and review your conditions meticulously before creating the rule.
</Warning>

1.  After you have carefully defined your rule name, selected the product(s), and set all conditions and price adjustments, click the **"Create rule"** button, located at the bottom of the page.
    *[Image: The bottom of the Targeting Rule creation page with the "Create rule" button clearly highlighted.]*

## Linking Targeting Rules to Offerings

Creating a Targeting Rule defines the logic, but it doesn't activate it for your users. To make a rule live, you must link it to an **Offering**. An Offering is what connects your Targeting Rules (and/or Paywalls) to your users. These entities work together in a sequence to deliver dynamic pricing:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Request with Offering ID in App] --> B[ParityDeals Fetches Offering Config]
    B --> C[Targeting Rule Linked to Offering]
    C --> D{Rule Conditions Met?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Price Adjustments Applied]
    D -->|No| F[No Adjustments from This Rule / Default]
    E --> G[Paywall / Plan Prices]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Final Pricing Displayed to User]
```

After successfully creating a Targeting Rule, you will be directed to the Offering creation page, with the "Create offering" modal appearing and your newly created rule pre-selected.

*[Image: The "Create Offering" modal automatically appearing after successful Targeting Rule creation, with the new rule pre-selected in the "Select targeting rule" field.]*

1.  **In the "Create offering" (or "Edit offering") modal:**
    * **Paywall Linking (Optional):** An option exists to "Skip if you don’t want to link a paywall to this offering." If your Offering's purpose is *only* to apply rule-based price adjustments without changing the visual paywall structure, you can skip this. Most often, however, you will link a paywall.
        *[Image: The "Create offering" modal highlighting the section/toggle for linking a Paywall, and an option like "Skip paywall linking" if applicable.]*
    * **Assign to Targeting Rule:** Ensure **"Targeting Rule"** is selected as the assignment type.
        *[Image: The "Assign to" section of the Offering modal, with "Targeting Rule" selected.]*
    * **Select Targeting Rule:** The dropdown will automatically have your newly created rule selected. If you are editing an existing offering or creating a new one independently, choose the desired rule from this list.
        *[Image: The "Select targeting rule" dropdown in the Offering modal, expanded to show a list of available rules, with one rule selected.]*
2.  Click **"Create"** (or "Update") on the Offering modal.

This action creates (or updates) the Offering and effectively activates your Targeting Rule. You will then receive or see the **Offering ID**.

* **Offering ID:** This ID is essential. Copy this ID and paste it into your application's code where you initialize the ParityDeals SDK or render the paywall component. This `Offering ID` instructs your application to apply the dynamic pricing and paywall configuration determined by the linked Targeting Rule.
    *[Image: A success modal or view after creating/updating an Offering, prominently displaying the "Offering ID" with a "Copy ID" button or icon highlighted.]*

## Managing Targeting Rules and Offerings Post-Creation

While rule conditions are immutable, you retain flexibility in managing your targeting strategies through rule naming and Offering edits.

### Editing Targeting Rule Names
To maintain clarity and organization, you can edit the name of a Targeting Rule after its creation. The rule's conditions and price adjustments remain unchanged.
1.  Navigate to **Monetization > Targeting Rules**.
2.  Locate the rule you wish to rename in the list.
3.  Click the **three-dot menu icon** on that rule's row and select **"Edit"** (or a similar "Rename" option).
    *[Image: The Targeting Rules list page, with the three-dot menu on a specific rule row expanded to clearly show the "Edit Name" or "Edit" option.]*
4.  Modify the name in the input field and save your changes.
    *[Image: The modal or edit view for changing a Targeting Rule's name, showing the name field and save button.]*

### Editing Offerings to Change Targeting Rules or Paywalls
The primary way to manage and iterate on your live targeting strategies is by editing the **Offering**. This approach provides significant flexibility without requiring code changes in your application.

<Info>
  **No Code Changes Needed for Iteration!**
  This system is specifically designed so that Product Managers, Go-To-Market teams, and Sales teams can dynamically update pricing strategies. You can roll out new paywalls, switch which Targeting Rule an Offering uses, or adjust the paywall linked to an Offering, all from the ParityDeals dashboard. The Offering ID in your application remains the same, ensuring seamless updates.
</Info>

1.  Navigate to **Monetization > Offerings**.
2.  Find the Offering you wish to modify in the list.
3.  Click its **three-dot menu icon** (or an "Edit" icon) and select **"Edit"**.
    *[Image: The Offerings list page, with the three-dot menu on an offering row expanded to clearly show the "Edit" option.]*
4.  In the "Edit offering" modal, you can:
    * Select a **different Targeting Rule** from the dropdown to change the pricing logic applied.
    * Select a **different Paywall** from the dropdown to change the visual presentation.
    *[Image: The "Edit offering" modal clearly showing dropdown menus for selecting a different Targeting Rule and/or a different Paywall, with options visible.]*
5.  Click **"Update"** (or "Save changes"). The Offering ID embedded in your code remains unchanged, but it now serves the new configuration (new rule and/or new paywall) to your users.
