<Warning>
  **Feature Status:** The ability to create targeting rules based on Browser, Platform, or Operating System is an upcoming feature and is not yet available. The steps below are illustrative of how this functionality might work within the ParityDeals Targeting Rules framework once released.
</Warning>

Targeting customers based on their device characteristics (like their operating system, browser, or platform) can enable specialized pricing strategies. For example, you might offer a discount to encourage mobile app adoption or provide different pricing to users on specific operating systems. This guide illustrates how such a rule might be configured and then activated.

## Part 1: Illustrative Example - Creating a "Mobile User Discount - Android" Rule (Coming Soon)

Let's imagine how you might set up a rule to offer a **10% discount** for users on the **Android** platform.

### 1. Navigate to Targeting Rules
1.  From the side navigation menu, go to **Monetization > Targeting rules**.
    * `[Image: ParityDeals navigation sidebar with "Targeting rules" highlighted under "Monetization".]`

### 2. Create a New Rule
1.  Click the **+ Create rule** button.
    * `[Image: "Targeting rules" list page with the "+ Create rule" button highlighted.]`

### 3. Define Rule Information
1.  **Rule name**: `Android User - 10% Mobile Discount (Illustrative)`.
2.  **Select product**: Choose the relevant product.
    * `[Image: "Create rule" modal - Rule Information section for an Android-specific rule.]`

### 4. Set Conditions (Illustrative)
1.  Under "If the customer matches...", click "Select condition".
2.  Choose **Platform / OS** from the list of attributes.
3.  Select the operator **is any of**.
4.  In the "Select" values field, search for and select **Android**.
    * `[Image: Illustrative "Create rule" modal - Conditions section, showing "Platform / OS" selected, "is any of", and "Android" chosen.]`
5.  *(Optional)* You could add another condition using **+ Add condition (and)**:
    * Choose **Browser**.
    * Select operator **is any of**.
    * Select a specific browser, e.g., **Chrome**.
    * `[Image: Illustrative "Create rule" modal - Conditions section, showing an additional "AND" condition for "Browser is any of Chrome".]`


### 5. Define the Pricing Adjustment (Action - Illustrative)
1.  Select **Decrease price by**.
2.  Enter `10` in the percentage field.
    * `[Image: Illustrative "Create rule" modal - Action section, showing "Decrease price by 10%".]`

### 6. Save the Rule
1.  Click **Create rule**.

**Result (Illustrative):** You would have created a rule that applies a 10% discount for Android users (optionally, only those using Chrome) for the selected product, once the feature is available.

## Potential Benefits of Device-Based Targeting (Once Available)

* **Promote Specific Platforms:** Encourage adoption of your mobile apps by offering discounts to mobile users.
* **Segment by User Behavior:** Different platforms or browsers might correlate with different user segments or willingness to pay.
* **Optimize for Device Capabilities:** Offer simplified (and potentially cheaper) plans for less capable devices if your product has varying feature sets.

## Part 2: Activating Your Device-Based Rule via an Offering (Once Available)

Once this feature is live, the Targeting Rule would be inactive until connected to an **Offering**.

1.  **Navigate to Offerings:**
    * Go to **Monetization > Offerings**.
    * `[Image: ParityDeals navigation sidebar with "Offerings" highlighted.]`
2.  **Create or Edit an Offering:**
    * Click **+ Create offering**.
    * `[Image: "Offerings" list page with "+ Create offering" button highlighted.]`
3.  **Link the Targeting Rule:**
    * In the "Create offering" (or "Edit offering") modal, choose the option to use a **Targeting rule**.
    * From the rule selection dropdown, choose the `Android User - 10% Mobile Discount (Illustrative)` rule.
    * `[Image: Illustrative "Create offering" modal showing "Targeting rule" option selected and the "Android User..." rule chosen.]`
4.  **Configure Other Offering Details:**
    * As needed, select a pricing table or configure other offering-specific settings.
5.  **Save/Create the Offering:**
    * Click **Create** (or "Update"). You will get an **Offering ID**.
    * `[Image: Offering creation success modal, highlighting the generated Offering ID.]`
6.  **Integrate:** Use this Offering ID in your application. When this Offering is requested, ParityDeals would (once the feature is live) evaluate the associated `Android User - 10% Mobile Discount` rule.

Your device-based pricing adjustment would then be active through this Offering once the underlying targeting capabilities are released.
