Country-specific pricing allows you to tailor your product's cost for customers in particular nations. This can be used for promotional campaigns, to match local market conditions, or to adjust for regional economic factors. This guide shows you how to set this up using Targeting Rules in ParityDeals and then activate your rule.

**Key Concept:** ParityDeals enables this by allowing you to create Targeting Rules based on the customer's `Country` attribute. The rule is then made live via an Offering.

## Part 2: Activating Your Country-Specific Rule via an Offering

A Targeting Rule is inactive until it's connected to an **Offering**. An Offering makes your product (with its associated rules) available to your users.

1.  **Navigate to Offerings:**
    * Go to **Monetization > Offerings**.
2.  **Create or Edit an Offering:**
    * Click **+ Create offering**. If you have an existing Offering you wish to use, you can edit it instead.
3.  **Link the Targeting Rule:**
    * In the "Create offering" (or "Edit offering") modal, choose the option that allows you to use a **Targeting rule**.
    * From the rule selection dropdown, choose the `India - Launch Discount 25%` rule you just created.
4.  **Configure Other Offering Details:**
    * You might need to select a paywall if this offering is presented through one, or configure other offering-specific settings.
5.  **Save/Create the Offering:**
    * Click **Create** (or "Update"). You will get an **Offering ID**.
6.  **Integrate:** Use this Offering ID in your application's code. When your application requests this Offering, ParityDeals will evaluate the associated `India - Launch Discount 25%` rule for the current user and apply the discount if the conditions are met.

Your Country-Specific pricing adjustment is now live and active through this Offering!
