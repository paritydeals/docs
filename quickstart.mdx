## What is ParityDeals?

ParityDeals is your operating system for usage-based billing, metering, and monetization. It helps you launch and scale products faster. You can easily deploy your pricing today and iterate with confidence tomorrow.

ParityDeals acts as the single source of truth for all customer usage and spending data. This empowers your teams to:

- Manage and update pricing strategies.
- Create real-time billing experiences.
- Drive revenue-generating workflows.

## Empowering Your Teams

Our platform gives engineering teams precise control over how features are packaged and priced. This allows your product and GTM teams to rapidly tweak, test, and roll out pricing changes without writing any code.


## Core Capabilities

ParityDeals gives you a complete toolkit to monetize your product. After a short integration with your codebase, you can use our no-code platform to:

- **Define Monetization:** Pinpoint exactly which product functionalities you want to charge for.

- **Adapt Packaging and Pricing:** Define and continuously adjust your product plans, and pricing models. This includes freemium, trials, usage-based tiers, and more.

- **Manage Customers:** Handle customer accounts, their subscriptions, and monitor their feature usage in one place.

- **Control Paywalls Remotely:** Instantly update and manage access rules for your paywalls without deploying new code.

- **Tailor Pricing for Any Audience:** Offer customized pricing based on location, purchasing power parity, device, or browser to improve monetization. All changes can be updated remotely without touching any code.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 
    1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `docs.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
    <Note>
      If youâ€™re currently using the legacy ```mint.json``` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:


      ```npm i -g mintlify@latest```
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      ```mintlify upgrade```
      You should now be using the new ```docs.json``` configuration file. Feel free to delete the ```mint.json``` file from your repository.

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
