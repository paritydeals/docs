title: 'Introduction to ParityDeals'

##### ParityDeals is the revenue OS built directly on Stripe so you can launch, localize, and optimize any pricing model without touching code.

---

## Why ParityDeals

Stripe handles payments. ParityDeals is the monetization layer — pricing localization, usage metering, feature access, and no-code paywalls — all while keeping Stripe as the source of truth

With ParityDeals you can:

- **Easily set up Stripe and billing**  
  Get started in minutes. You don’t have to handle dozens of webhooks, build a database layer to mirror Stripe customers, track subscription states, or hardcode feature access in your code.

- **Run any pricing model**  
  Flat fee, usage, seats, tiers, volume, credits, pay-as-you-go, overage charges, or hybrids. Configure them in minutes.

- **Meter usage in real time**  
  Count every API hit, data storage unit, AI token, or active user as it happens. Add limits, alerts, and overages with one call.

- **Localized pricing by country**  
  Offer country-specific prices in 135+ currencies with VPN, proxy, and fraud protection built in.

- **Ship pricing changes without touching code**  
  A/B test plans, roll out changes, or update pricing in real time without redeploys.

- **Manage the full customer lifecycle**  
  Handle upgrades, downgrades, migrations, overrides, and grandfathering without writing custom scripts.

## Who ParityDeals is for

- **Developers** — integrate billing without spending weeks on webhooks, custom usage code, and hardcoded feature flags  

- **Product managers** — take ownership of pricing and plans. Run experiments, roll out promotions, and update entitlements directly from the dashboard without waiting for engineering  

- **Founders** — launch global pricing and usage-based models from day one. Configure billing once and manage everything from the dashboard without code changes
